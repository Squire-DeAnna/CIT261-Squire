     Dave is a very literal guide which comes in handy when shouting out
     commands. His background, while not the most pleasant, has made him
     into a very positive and caring individual. We've had several parents
     and teens compliment his can do attitude.
     <br>
     In his spare time, Dave likes to hike the trails of the Salmon River
     State Park. He is an expert on the different foliage, more specifically
     the trees, in the area. He also likes coming across the local wildlife in
     their natural habitat, though he has a few racoon friends that live
     closer to his home.
     <br>
     When rafting with Dave, you'll enjoy all the water and landscape have
     to offer!
