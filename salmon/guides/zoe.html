     Level 10 Certification <br>
     7 Years of Experience<br>
     Zoe may not be our most experienced guide in professional terms, but
     her determination and love of rafting has made her the most successful
     guide that we have had the pleasure of working with. She grew up on
     the rivers of America, rafting with her family, until a scout found 
     her and recruited her for their professional rafting team, the 'Accusers'.
     <br>
     After finding out that they had cheated to win, Zoe left the team
     and came to work for us. She said that it's brought her a sense
     of peace and belonging to help others get started with rafting. 
     With her quick wit and rafting skills, you will have no trouble
     in the water when rafting with Zoe!
