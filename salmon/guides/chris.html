     Chris has been a part of our team for two and a half years now, 
     coming from a long history of amatuer white water rafting 
     for the 'Ravagers', a team that still has yet to rank in any reafting
     competition. He came to us knowing that his skills could be put to 
     good use helping others understand and enjoy white water rafting.
     <br>
     His favorite past time is to go moonlight water rafting. He's very 
     adept at spotting the white water with even just the light of the 
     stars, earning him his nickname of 'Star Lord'. We guarantee that you
     will be in very capable and humorous hands with Chris.
